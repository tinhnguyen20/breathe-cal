      'The key to reducing mold is to keep your home dry:
      Fix leaky faucets and pipes
      Make sure rooms are properly ventilated
      Use a vented exhaust fan to remove excess moisture
      Keep humidity levels below 50% with air conditioners and dehumidifiers
      Use cleaning solutions designed to kill mold and mildew

Wear a mask to mow the lawn, or ask someone without allergies to help.
