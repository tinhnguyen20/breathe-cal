Feature: client searches 
  As an allergy sufferer with a user account
  in order to know what cities I have recently searched for, 
  I should see the last 5 cities I searched for at the bottom of the sidebar on the landing page.

@javascript   
Scenario: I should see a blank search history before having searched for anything
    Given I am on the landing page
    # Then I should see the text on the side "Recent Searches"

@javascript   
Scenario: Having searched for a city I should see it displayed on the page
    When I go to the landing page
    And my location is set to "Berkeley"
    And I follow "Recent Searches" 
    Then I should see the text on the side "Berkeley"
    And I should not see "Vancouver"
    And I should not see "Boston"

@javascript   
Scenario: Having searched for two cities I should see the most recent one on top
    When I go to the landing page
    And my location is set to "Berkeley"
    And I follow "Recent Searches"
    And my location is set to "Albany"
    And I follow "Recent Searches"
    Then I should see the text on the side "Berkeley"
    Then I should see the text on the side "Albany"
    And I should see "Berkeley" above "Albany"    

# @javascript   
# Scenario: Having searched for more than 5 cities I should only see the last 5 ones displayed
#     Given I as "client1" have searched for "Berkeley"
#     And I as "client1" have searched for "Albany"
#     And I as "client1" have searched for "Oakland"
#     And I as "client1" have searched for "Richmond"
#     And I as "client1" have searched for "San Francisco"
#     And I as "client1" have searched for "San Jose"
#     And I am on the landing page
#     Then I should see "San Jose"
#     And I should see "San Francisco"
#     And I should see "Richmond"
#     And I should see "Oakland"
#     And I should see "Albany"
#     And I should not see "Berkeley"
